      "title": "BIG LAGOON",

      "part4": "#The beach is rather small#, huge karst cliffs surround you and there are coconut palms. The beach is particularly peaceful as everyone walks towards the main attraction.",
      "part5": "To access the secret lagoon, you must head to the left of the island, the secret lagoon is #accessible through a hole dug in the rock# (watch out, it's slippery).",
      "part6": "Inside, there is #a mini lagoon entirely surrounded by cliffs#, the water is very cloudy. Certainly very beautiful when there is nobody, unfortunately for us, it was the most crowded place that we visited here.",
      "part7": "We didn't wait that long to get in and we were able to take some pictures but our « guide » told us that sometimes you could queue for 10 minutes or more ...",
      "part8": "We were also told that this beach might be completely filled with #jellyfish# during the least popular months. During our stay we could already spot a lot of small jellyfish even if it was only the beginning of March jellyfish are more common from April."

      "part2": "Part of the beach, with seats and hammocks, is private.",
      "part3": "There is an area for swimming and snorkeling, delimited by buoys to protect you from frequent boats that pass by. However snorkeling is not very interesting. There are not a lot of fish or corals. Be careful to not get too far if you snorkel, buoys have not been added for decoration only.",
      "part4": "This island is mainly interesting to #relax and sunbathe#.",
      "part5": "For the story, the name given to this island « 7 Commando Beach » comes from 7 soldiers that got lost during the Second World War and would have remained there to live like Robinson Crusoe. The story does not tell how long or what happened to them, however it seems that they carved their names on some rocks."
