      "part1": "From afar, the island looks huge. Unfortunately, a big part of the beach is private. It's quite easy to notice because the private part is separated using wooden barriers.",
      "part2": "If you come with a Tour then you will be left on the right side of the island. The smallest part.",
      "part3": "You can easily recognize the island with #its mushroom-shaped rock#.",
      "part4": "And despite being on a small side of the island, the view is really stunning.",
      "part5": "Take the opportunity to #take a whole bunch of photos#, of anything and everything. I had a blast on this island. Even if it's tiny, I wanted to take a photo of every little thing. Maybe I was really enthusiastic because it was our first visit to the Bacuit Archipelago, but I was satisfied with a little.",
      "part6": "Be careful. It's better to #come in the morning# to enjoy the best weather. In the afternoon, don't expect sunlight as the island will be under the shade.",
      "part7": "Snorkeling is not really interesting here. You need to get far away in order to find anything, if any."

      "part2": "Your boat drops you off near the island. Be careful on the way down, there are quite a few small pebbles in the water.",
      "part3": "You can either climb the small hill or cross and walk on the sandbank.",
      "part4": "We started by the small hill. We therefore ventured on a rather rough path. It's better to have walking shoes here. I wore sandals and faced troubles especially because they were completely slippery after walking in the water.",
      "part5": "On the way, we met a cute little kitten, he didn't seem disturbed, not at all, by me and the millions of photos I took of him.",
      "part6": "We finally reached the top, in the middle of trees. From there, we tried to find the best place to enjoy the view and take photos.",
      "part7": "#The view from the top is just incredible# (shame on us, we brought the wrong lens so we couldn't take a picture of the full sandbank).",
      "part8": "#Then we walked on the sandbank#. This path brings you back to the island of Palawan.",
      "part9": "Along the way, admire the color variations due to the seabed, an exceptional view.",
      "part10": "If you like to walk by the water, you will be served. This little getaway is really very pleasant. Beware of sunburn on the other hand!",

      "part3": "Maybe you think this island is like any other island and that you start to get bored of it. Think again, it is undoubtedly on this island that you will be able to take the most diverse photos and therefore you will observe #many different landscapes#. For that, you have to walk and not just stay on the beach.",
      "part4": "I don't know how to explain it, it looks  like there is an island full of coconut put over a normal island, filled with white sand. It makes it look like #palm trees are flying# somehow and that they don't touch the ground.",
