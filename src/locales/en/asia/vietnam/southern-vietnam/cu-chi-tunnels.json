    "part1": "As the tunnels are located in Southern Vietnam, the best season to visit is definitely during the dry season, from #December to April#.",
    "part2": "Nothing prevents you from going there during the rainy season since the tunnels can't be flooded. That being said the tunnels will transform into a very muddy place, because of humidity and rain, and it will be much less pleasant to visit. Take note that inside the tunnels you will have to walk in squatting position most of the time.",
    "part3": "We went there in February, Ho Chi Minh City was quite crowded but we felt it might be the case all year round. On the other hand during our visits to the tunnels or on the Mekong Delta it was quite deserted."

    "part1": "First of all, there are two different sites to visit the tunnels: #Ben Dinh et Ben Duoc#. Ben Dinh is the nearer but it's also said to be the more touristy, whereas Ben Duoc is said to be the most authentic, from the different opinions we gathered.",
    "part2": "We didn't pay attention while booking at all. We only booked what suits best our needs, but it seems that we have been to Ben Duoc.",

    "part2": "Mainly known because the Vietnamese Resistance were entrenched inside during the Vietnam War, the tunnels were first built during Indochina War.",
    "part3": "The construction started during the #1940s# by the Viet Minh. The tunnels were used primarily to escape from French soldiers and during the Vietnam War they were enlarged to reach #250 km#.",
    "part4": "#The construction took about 25 years#.",
    "part5": "These tunnels served a key role for the victory of the Vietnamese Resistance during the Vietnam War.",
    "part6": "We mentioned the Vietnamese Resistance, also known as the Viet Cong. However, this word, meaning Vietnamese Communist, is pejorative and was used during the Vietnam War. Except that members of the Resistance were not all communists. All the fighters, regardless of their convictions, fought together for the independence and reunification of Vietnam."

    "part4": "Imagine that in the most dangerous places people have spent #most of their lives underground#.",
    "part5": "We wonder how people were able to move around even though everything has been enlarged. We had to walk in squatting position, sometimes on our knees even if those tunnels were probably more comfortable compare to the inaccessible ones.",
    "part6": "We have walked through two different tunnels.",
    "part7": "The first one, made for most of the tourists but where we couldn't even stand.",
    "part8": "The other one was much narrower, we walked in a squatting position all the way. Before reaching the end, it was so narrow that we had to walk on our knees.",
    "part9": "The guides are used to this and you understand it quickly. While we were in pain to reach the end of the tunnel, our guide was already out and fresh. Once, we were afraid to get lost, when our guide took a turn and disappeared, while he was quite far away.",
    "part10": "#Total immersion# to realize how it must have been harder, more than one can really imagine.",
    "part11": "We were just visitors and staying more than an hour underground is already oppressive, so to imagine they had to stay several days there sometimes...",
    "part12": "The Cu Chi tunnels have been enlarged to house entire underground villages. They were excavated in a zig-zag pattern, to prevent enemies from having a clear view and on several floors, usually #3 levels of different depths#.",
    "part13": "The first level were used for defense where traps were installed.",
    "part14": "On the second floor, around 6m deep, there were the kitchens, hospitals and assembly rooms.",
    "part15": "On the last floor, around over 12m deep, there were the weapons warehouses as well as the manufacturing workshops and munitions factories. There were also dormitories and living quarters."

    "part5": "punji stick: traps hidden by foliage that formed a large pit with stakes at the bottom from which it was almost impossible to get out",
    "part6": "The stakes were mostly constructed with cut wood or bamboo and were often #coated with poison to be even more effective#.",

    "part4": "You can also rest a bit to taste delicious and fresh coconut water.",
    "part5": "If you are interested about the history of Vietnam, you definitely should visit the Cu Chi Tunnels. We also advise you to visit the [War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City](ho-chi-minh-war-museum), which adds the final touch to understand the Vietnam War."

  "visit6": {
    "title": "Good to know",
    "part1": "To find hidden entrances and detect the smell of their enemies, the Americans used shepherd dogs, renowned for their sense of smell.",
    "part2": "However the Vietnamese Resistance began to use American soap to counter the smell of dogs. Additionally, they stole American military uniforms in order to fool dogs even more.",
    "part3": "In the end, American forces trained soldiers to navigate through the tunnels in order to detect traps and the presence of Vietnamese troops. They were called the \"tunnel rats\"."

  "conclusion": "These tunnels show us how resourceful and determined the Vietnamese were. We almost felt as being buried alive before seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. An experience to live even if it you can't forget all the suffering associated with this place.",
