    "part3": "We met tourists yelling for scam because they had to pay 50,000 VND ... It's not $50,000! It's $2 ... Only $2 ... The currency conversion to VND is a bit complicated to do, but take the necessary time to convert the prices. We use the [Currency application](http://www.currencyapp.com/), the best application in our opinion. And it does work offline.",
    "part4": "To tell you the truth, it's up to you to get informed about prices before travelling, whether it is about activities, guided tours, meals or anything you plan to buy.",

    "part6": "That's why we advise to book taxis with the [Grab application](https://www.grab.com/transport/) in Asian countries. It is the simplest way to book a taxi and avoid scammers. You know the price straight when booking with the application, and you will always find taxis around you."
