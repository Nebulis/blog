    "part3": "[Kuretake Inn Nagoya Hisaya Odori](booking-hotel:jp/kuretake-inn-nagoya-hisayaodori) is a very nice hotel, conveniently located 10-15 minutes walk from Nagoya Castle. The room and the bathroom were clean though a bit small. For one or two nights, it was perfect, very cozy."

  "visit1": {
    "title": "A bit of History",
    "part1": "Nagoya Castle owes its name to the city it is located, Nagoya, in Aichi Prefecture, Japan.",
    "part2": "#Completed in 1615#, it is one of the many castles in Japan to have been partially destroyed, especially by bombardments during World War II in 1945.",
    "part3": "In 1930, it was the first castle to be designated a national treasure.",
    "part4": "In 1959, the main dungeon was rebuilt identically, and the interior transformed into a museum.",
    "part5": "In 2009 started a #gigantic project: the renovation of all the buildings by using the original materials#. This project includes the reconstruction of the Honmaru Palace, which is now partially open to the public.",
    "part6": "Since 2019, the main dungeon is also under renovation. The goal is to rebuild it in wood to restore its authenticity. The renovation should be completed in 2022.",
    "part7": "#Despite all this work, most of the buildings remain open to the public#.",
    "part8": "You may notice that Nagoya Castle and Osaka Castle look similar from the outside, whether in color or construction shape. Even if [Osaka Castle](osaka-castle) is much more famous, a visit to both is well worth the detour"
  },
  "visit2": {
    "title": "Entry of the castle",
    "part1": "The entrance is already a spectacle from afar. #Surrounded by a moat# and cherry trees, we cross a small bridge which gradually brings us into the immense park of the castle. Nature has somewhat regained its rights in the first moat that we see.",
    "part2": "When entering the park, you are spoiled for choice because it is so big.",
    "part3": "The park and the castle are #protected by a huge wall and watchtowers#. There are three of them, all in their original condition.",
    "part4": "These towers look like replicas of [Himeji Castle](himeji-castle), which already reminds us of memories of the first day.",
    "part5": "The interior of the Southwest Watchtower is open to the public and offers an overview from the top floor as well as a view of the buildings of Nagoya."
  },
  "visit3": {
    "title": "Honmaru palace",
    "part1": "Before reaching the castle, you will pass the Honmaru Palace.",
    "part2": "After about ten years of reconstruction and renovation to restore its authenticity thanks to original photos and archives, the palace opens its doors. You will discover a resplendent architecture, #multiple paintings transcribed identically on the walls and sliding doors#, tigers, leopards, birds, landscapes, and temples, all with a dazzling golden yellow.",
    "part3": "As with most places to visit, you must take off your shoes to enter the palace. Slippers are available."
  },
  "visit4": {
    "title": "Visit of the castle",
    "part1": "Arrived at the castle, we discover that we cannot visit the interior because it is under construction. Unfortunately, we didn't check beforehand. A little disappointed, we still appreciate the view from the outside.",
    "part2": "Inside the castle, you will have the chance to discover an #art museum#. It contains many paintings and many objects that depict the castle's history.",
    "part3": "On the top floor, the seventh, you can enjoy a #panoramic view# of the entire city of Nagoya.",
    "part4": "From the outside, you will notice elevators inside the dungeon (there is one outside too). It is a bit shocking. The interior would therefore be much #more modern# than you might think from afar. According to a few reviews from fellow travelers, it is still worth the visit. It's just a little less authentic.",
    "part5": "You can visit the castle with a tour guide, tours in English start at 1:00 p.m. each day. No reservations are required, and the guided tour is free. Tour guides are waiting for people near the main gate.",
    "part6": "As we told you earlier, Nagoya Castle is similar to Osaka Castle, in color and shape. Indeed, its walls are white, and its multiple roofs are green.",
    "part7": "#At the top of the main dungeon, you can observe two gold statues. These statues are named « Kinshachi », « Shachihoko » or even « Shachi-Gawara » . They represent dolphins, mythical animals protecting the building from fires#"

  "visit5": {
    "title": "The gardens",
    "part1": "In front of the castle, there is a perfect cherry blossom spot. During the annual cherry blossom festival, the paths are illuminated and the castle stays open longer.",
    "part2": "Of course, depending on the season, you will be entitled to different colors. In autumn, the red maples and in spring, the cherry trees. Talking about cherry trees, their dark trunk and their pinkish-white flowers change from the intense pink cherry trees that we have often seen previously.",
    "part3": "#The gardens extend all around the castle#.",
    "part4": "On one side, you have a lake, and swans seem to like it. A path allows you to go around it, which is quite nice since most people stay near the castle to take pictures. You will find yourself alone in the world.",
    "part5": "On the other side, there is an even more spacious garden, surprisingly calm again, where #rose bushes replace cherry trees#.",
    "part6": "Enjoy this park to discover the #historic downtown# and escape the hustle and bustle of the city.",
    "part7": "Before leaving, observe the castle that appears through the trees one last time."
