The rooms are a bit dated though, but the view of the lake or Mount Fuji is appreciable. It’s not luxury, but fine for few nights. Right in front of the lake, the location is perfect.",

    "part3": "Enjoy a change of scenery between each season as well. Cherry trees in spring, lavenders and multiple flowers in summer, red maples in autumn, and snow in winter. There will always be something to delight you according to your preferences.",
    "part4": "#Motosuko Lake#",
    "part5": "Particularly difficult to access by public transportation, with poorly developed infrastructures. It is popular for camping. It is one of the only lakes in Fujigoko that does not freeze in winter because the water never drops below 4° C. The view of Mount Fuji from this lake appears on the ¥ 1,000 banknote.",
    "part6": "#Shojiko Lake#",
    "part7": "It is the smallest of the five lakes, located between Motosu Lake and Sai Lake. Better served by public transportation than Lake Motosu, there are few hotels, but you can enjoy camping.",

    "part4": "In April, it's still a bit cold in the evening. We do not venture too far from our hotel but we already appreciate this very nice first sight.",
    "part5": "Going around the lake is interesting if you are looking for #the best spot to take photos#. You can simply stroll and breathe some fresh air. Bike rentals can be found all over the place. Our hotel lends some, but we assume that is the case all around.",
    "part6": "However, the city itself is of very little interest.",
    "part7": "#Like a ghost town#. There were no restaurants open at night, despite being there during the touristy season. We were a little disappointed. We think they open mainly in summer.",
    "part8": "That said, the place is worth the detour for a day. The train is like an attraction. The walk around the lake is pleasant and helps to escape the hustle and bustle. Lastly, the view of Mount Fuji is exceptional.",
    "part9": "#A different view at every moment of the day.#",
    "part10": "Regarding the cable car:",
