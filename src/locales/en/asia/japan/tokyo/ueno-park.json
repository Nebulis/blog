    "part2": "The park is home to #several museums, temples, and shrines#, hidden everywhere and which you will find by following the different paths. We didn't visit these places.",

    "part4": "We had already share about it on our [Himeji Castle](himeji-castle) article, but you will surely see on the ground or the grass, multiple blue tarpaulins. Let's be honest it's very ugly. But it allows visitors to sit and share a moment.",

    "part9": "The park is also busy due to its #huge zoo#. Open 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (price: ¥600; free for children), it is the oldest zoo in Japan. You will see many animals such as tigers, bears, monkeys, and even African animals. However, the real attraction star is #the giant panda couple#.",
    "part10": "If you've never been to Kyoto and haven't had the chance to visit the thousands Torii of [Fushimi Inari Taisha](fushimi-inari-taisha), you can experience it here. Much less impressive, it still remains a unique moment.",
    "part11": "Continue to stroll through the gardens. You might find other buildings or Sakuras spots."
