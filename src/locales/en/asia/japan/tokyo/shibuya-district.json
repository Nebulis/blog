    "part3": "It is not the area where you will see traditional temples or castles. However, it's exactly what we were looking for to discover Tokyo."

    "part3": "We have often heard about Starbuck to be the best spot to get an overview of the crossing. We weren't convinced and we still think there much better places. We were right in front, but taking pictures was a bit complicated.",
    "part4": "It’s both amazing and fun to do and watch. The Shibuya crossing is an #intersection with five crosswalks#. When the pedestrian traffic light turns green, thousands of people cross.",
    "part5": "Statistics show there are #2,500 people per crossing and 2.4 million people per day#. Staggering figure that makes it the busiest crosswalks in the world."

    "part4": "Unfortunately, in 1925, the professor died at work and did not return. Even so, Hachiko kept going to the Shibuya Train Station for ten years (until he died in 1935). Every morning and afternoon, he sat for hours waiting for the return of his owner.",
    "part5": "The statue was #built in 1934#. Today, it is an emblem and symbol of the Shibuya district, which attracts thousands of people to take a simple photo to remember this #beautiful love story between a dog and his master#."

    "part4": "There are a lot of food shops as well. You can even buy a rainbow cotton candy there to blend in with the crowd.",
    "part5": "Go there on Sunday you will see many #cosplays#. You will also see some during weekdays, but they often meet on Sundays or weekends.",
