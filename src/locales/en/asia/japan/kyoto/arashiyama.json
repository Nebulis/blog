There are many different kinds of hotels, and it's not necessarily very well indicated (hotels with a shared room or shared bathroom. Read carefully!). Also, check out smoking and non-smoking rooms. It's one of the few countries where there are many smoking rooms.",

    "part3": "So many different names just for this little forest.",
    "part4": "In Kyoto, you will probably discover many famous places renowned for their scenery in Japan. The bamboo forest is one of them. There is also the Torii of [Fushimi Inari-Taisha](fushimi-inari-taisha) or the golden temple, the [Kinkaku-Ji temple](kinkakuji). Those are must-see places that you cannot miss if you come to Japan and even less to Kyoto."

    "part3": "#During this little walk, you already feel like in a different place. Like being in a small village.#",
    "part4": "The houses are very typical, small, and square-shaped. Very different from houses in France. I don't know if we could imagine living here. During the visit, we felt good and cozy but I think after some time we would feel oppressed. Not to mention the crowd. A horde of tourists every day in your street must be very unpleasant. Anyway, this stroll in the street is quite enjoyable.",
    "part5": "We also notice some buildings with roofs that remind us with joy [Himeji castle](himeji-castle). The curved wooden roof with the fish-shaped statues called the Shashi-Gawara. Still fresh in our memory, since we visited the castle the day before.",
    "part6": "At the end of the road, we arrive in a busy street.",
    "part7": "Here you will find everything, restaurants, typical shops. We mainly saw tea and tableware shops, but the street is quite long, and we did not reach the end."

    "part1": "To visit Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, you can #walk# or hire a #pulled rickshaw# (~ ¥5,000). We noticed that some people mentioned it was doable by bike. However, when we have been, it was forbidden. Perhaps due to the crowd that day or due to the season (spring).",
    "part2": "Despite the crowd, the atmosphere is relaxing.",
    "part3": "Listen to the bamboos bumping into each other when the wind blows, a unique moment.",
    "part4": "At first, we thought we would not enjoy the walk because of the crowd. But in the end, we live in the moment, and #it's so magical#. On top of that, we've never seen this anywhere else, so we almost forget all those people.",
    "part5": "Of course, if you are lucky enough to visit when there are few people, you will surely be able to appreciate more than us #the calm and the sound of the wind on the bamboos.#",
    "part6": "But we still wonder how to escape these waves of people. Maybe the only way to escape is not to come? But it would be a shame not to appreciate this place. Don't forget that it is Japan and you will rarely be alone. And do not deprive yourself of visiting unmissable sites because of the tourists and locals.",
    "part7": "We still manage to find places where there is no one, which is much more enjoyable, we are not going to lie.",
    "part8": "To be alone in the middle of these gigantic trees is truly impressive. As #nature lovers#, we couldn't feel better anywhere else right now.",
    "part9": "I even imagine a little panda appearing in front of us. An unrealizable dream of course. This place makes me realize how much I am excited to visit [China](china). Especially the sanctuaries of these big teddy bears. The dream of a little girl.",
    "part10": "This walk makes me travel far away...",
    "part11": "Let's go back to our visit...",
    "part12": "The path narrows more and more. The bamboos, #several tens of meters high#, stand in front of you and let just a trickle of sunlight pass through. The weather is a bonus.",
    "part13": "In less-dense places, you can see the sky. We were lucky to have a beautiful blue sky that morning. The view is more pleasant.",
    "part14": "#Bamboo is a symbol of longevity, youth, prosperity, and strength. It would be able to repel evil spirits and negative energy. It could also bring more luck#.",
    "part15": "This plant acts as a lucky charm.",

    "part27": "#A short walk#, in the end, only #500 meters#, and some paths are reserved for rickshaws. There is only one way for people that walk, and we can quickly get stuck.",
    "part28": "Some bamboos are unfortunately very damaged because of some ill-intentioned tourists who carve their names on the bamboos. A real shame!",
    "part29": "Please, we can never say it enough but take care of the things surrounding us. Nature is so beautiful. We must all continue to preserve it as much as possible. Doing this kind of nonsense is just useless. Who cares that Karen came on March 17, 2019, to this place. Not us.",
    "part30": "To hide the carved name, you will notice that some bamboos have green tape... what a waste for such a beautiful place."

    "part12": "Entrance fee (¥550). Open every day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.",
    "part13": "At the top of a hill, access a platform for a view of Arashiyama. You will inevitably see macaques used to people and who are in total freedom in this park. Be careful with your bags, cameras, and whatever else you hold in your hand. Monkeys are known to steal items and can be aggressive if they don't have what they want. We have seen this in Cambodia in the [Angkor Temples](angkor-wat) and Bali, in the [Ubud Monkey Forest](ubud-monkey-park).",
    "part14": "#[Togetsukyo Bridge](togetsukyo-bridge)#.",

    "part20": "Garden with several buildings located on a hill. The higher you go, the more you have a magnificent and unobstructed view of Kyoto. In autumn, the many maple trees may cut off the panorama a little, but this will make your visit even more beautiful, thanks to their intense color in the high season. At the top, you can visit the Taho-To pagoda.",
    "part21": "#[Kimono Forest](arashiyama-kimono-forest)#:",
    "part22": "Open every day until 11 p.m.",
    "part23": "Near the Arashiyama Tram Station, you will find this set of pillars covered with colorful kimono patterns. At night the pillars are illuminated to make it more incredible.",
