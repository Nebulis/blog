    "part1": "Located in the Fushimi-Ku district of Kyoto, Fushimi Inari-Taisha is a Shinto shrine, also known as « Oinari-san ». It was #built in 711# and spans #over 850,000 square meters#.",
    "part2": "This shrine is #dedicated to the goddess Inari Okami#, worshiped as the guardian deity of harvest, trade, peace, and prosperity.",
    "part3": "#You will be able to see many statues inside the sanctuary. These statues are called « Komainu ». They have the form of a mythical fox called « Kitsune ».#",
    "part4": "These foxes are believed to be the messengers and servants of this goddess. Each fox spirit would communicate our wishes to Inari Okami and stand guard while warding off evil spirits.",
    "part5": "Each statue holds in its mouth an object related to Inari Okami, such as a rice stalk, a rice granary key, or even a parchment."

  "visit2": {
    "title": "The Torii",
    "part1": "A torii is a #traditional Japanese gate#. It is usually built at the sanctuary entrance to chase away evil spirits. Most of the time, there is only one Torii. However, you will see #around ten thousand of them at Fushimi Inari-Taisha#, which is why this shrine is so famous. It is rare to see so many torii in the same place and even less aligned like that.",
    "part2": "Traditionally built of wood, there are also more and more made of stone. They are mainly #painted in vermilion#, a bright red with a bit of orange, because this color is the symbol of life force.",
    "part3": "These thousands of Torii form a path in the forest of #Mount Inari, a mountain culminating at 233 meters#, to reach the main building of the sanctuary. These multiple columns of Torii are called « #Senbon Torii# ». Breathtaking architecture.",
    "part4": "Each torii is a donation made by individuals or companies. #Either in appreciation of a wish made or to make one#. On each torii, you will find the name and the date of the donation. The information is written in Japanese making it particularly pretty and attractive, aesthetically speaking. The price of a Torii can go up to over a million yen depending on its location, condition, and the other Torii around it. It is also up to each torii owner to take care of its maintenance, which is why you will probably see some torii much less colorful than others and much less maintained."

    "part6": "We follow the stairs from the base of the hill.",
    "part7": "Before #going under the Torii#, we come across some monuments to pray and purify ourselves. Before entering a temple, it would be customary to wash your hands and mouth.",
    "part8": "The walk begins with a lot of steps and then some paths. A route around these famous Torii. Some shrines visible from time to time to rest or admire the view.",
    "part9": "Most people only come to take a few photos in the Torii tunnel and then leave. At least you will feel alone to climb up the mountain.",
    "part10": "You don't need to do #the hike, which lasts about 2 hours#. The complex is already prestigious, and just by walking near the temple, you will discover lots of small places. You can also turn back at any time.",
    "part11": "We will be going back at a less touristy period. We hope we will be luckier with the weather next time (be careful when it rains the floor is slippery)."
