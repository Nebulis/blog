    "title": "A bit of history",

    "part2": "It owes its name Kinkaku (Ji meaning temple) due to its nickname, the #Golden Pavilion#. It is also known as Rokuon-Ji, which means #Imperial Deer Garden Temple#.",
    "part3": "It was destroyed many times and in particular because of fires. The last one happened in 1950. Fortunately, it was rebuilt identically five years later.",
    "part4": "In 1987, it was renovated and received a new and much thicker layer of gold. #Its last renovation happened in 2020#, a very recent renovation to give it even more brilliance and allow the beauty of its colors to remain intact throughout the seasons.",
    "part5": "Despite all these events, Kinkaku-Ji is a faithful reconstruction of its original design.",
    "part6": "In 1994, the temple was #listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site#.",
    "part7": "Kyoto is one of Japan's cities where you can see many emblematic sites. The Kinkaku-Ji temple is one of them, but you also have the very [famous bamboo grove](arashiyama) or the Torii of [Fushimi Inari Taisha](fushimi-inari-taisha). And if gold is not enough for you, the silver temple [Ginkaku-Ji](ginkakuji) might also delight you."

    "part3": "We are lucky because the weather is good. We can see the walls covered with #golden leaves reflecting in the water#.",
    "part4": "Then we go around the pond to get closer to the golden temple.",
    "part5": "We approach more and more the temple, to admire the golden leaves. The closer you get, the smoother they look. We can finally see the #Chinese phoenix Fenghuang which stays at the top#.",
    "part6": "Adjacent to the temple is a small pagoda that serves as a terrace above the pond.",
    "part7": "The building is entirely covered with gold, except for the first floor. Although the interior is closed to the public, you can still see #Buddha's relics#.",
    "part8": "This temple is very popular. Don't expect to be alone. The crowd might be unpleasant for such a zen place. As we often mention, it's not simple to find places with no crowd in Japan.",
    "part9": "The temple is famous for its unique beauty and because it fits well with the background, the forest that surrounds it throughout the seasons.",
    "part10": "#[In Spring in Japan](spring-in-japan)#, to admire the temple's reflection in the pond when the sky is blue.",
    "part11": "#[In Autumn in Japan](autumn-in-japan)#, the few red, orange, or yellow maple leaves mixed with the golden color of the temple. It will give a different effect, like a flaming landscape.",
    "part12": "#[In Winter in Japan](winter-in-japan)#, it is probably the most beautiful season in our opinion to go there. Despite the cold, you can appreciate the snow and the frozen pond."

    "part3": "Buildings are scattered all over to allow you to #meditate or make wishes#. Throw a coin in, fortune may be with you.",
    "part4": "Going up will allow you to see the garden from a different angle. Small statues all around and waterfalls make the visit very special.",
    "part5": "Discover the Zen side of Japan by walking along the path that borders the pond. Admire the gorgeous landscape with this magnificent pine mountain in the background.",
