    "part1": "Queensland is divided into two main seasons, a hot and humid summer (November to April) and a milder, drier winter (May to October). Nicknamed the « #Sunshine State# », it's one of the sunniest states in Australia, with 300 sunny days per year.",

      "title": "Townsville",
      "part1": "First, we stop in this coastal town.",
      "part2": "There is plenty to do here, but we are mainly looking for a nice place to stop our van and rest.",
      "part3": "However, if you have some time, you can always go to #Reef HQ, the largest coral aquarium in the world.#",
      "part4": "We arrive near the sea and enjoy as much as we can. We don't want to be in the middle of the city, so no tall building, no car, just the calm. It's so good!",
      "part5": "The sunset informs us that it is time to rest because we will need a lot of energy for the next day.",
      "part6": "Here we are on one of my most impatiently awaited activities, #meeting the largest colony of koalas living in the wild.#",
      "part7": "Let's head to #Magnetic Island# for an incredible day in this preserved natural park. On our agenda: discovery of the beaches surrounding the island, hikes in the forest, and meeting with these endemic animals of Australia."

      "part3": "Unfortunately, unsuccessfully. Still, it remains a great memory, and maybe you'll be luckier than us, that's why we share it with you."

    "part4": {
      "title": "Cairns",
      "part1": "Cairns is located approximately 350 kilometers north of Townsville. It's the ideal starting point for exploring #the Great Barrier Reef.#",
      "part2": "And that's part of why we came here.",
      "part3": "But first of all, we had planned a day in the tropical forest, discovering #Kuranda Village and its aboriginal culture#. An unfortunately very touristy attraction that we especially liked for the unusual transportation.",
      "part4": "Discovering the Great Barrier Reef is a must-see on a trip to Australia.",
      "part5": "The Great Barrier Reef is #the largest coral reef in the world# and can even be seen from space. It is home to thousands of species, from the smallest to the largest: tropical fish, crustaceans, corals, dolphins, turtles. An extremely diverse underwater fauna.",
      "part6": "With 2,900 reefs and 900 islands, we were spoilt from choice, but we decided to head to #Green Island#.",
      "part7": "Boat trip, diving, snorkeling, or just sunbathing on the beach. The last day was both entertaining and relaxing.",
      "part8": "There are many other great places for you to discover in Queensland. After our 3-week road trip, it was time for us to come back and get back to our normal life, but we hope to come back and discover more.",
